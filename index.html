					<p>
						I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student in Columbia University's NLP Lab. My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, linguistics, and the social sciences, namely political science and psychology. I am advised by Professor Kathleen McKeown, and I am generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the Columbia Presidential Fellowship, and the Provost Diversity Fellowship.

				<h1> Research </h1>
				<hr>
				<p> My research in Natural Language Processing focuses on three primary themes: (1) the application of language models to social science-relevant tasks, (2) investigating and mitigating biases in language models, and (3) increasing language model robustness in processing unclean, unstructured text from social media. In the social sciences, I am particularly interested in the application of NLP to suicidality, mental health, and emotions in psychology as well as to political rhetoric and polarization in political science.
